# Experiment with Golang: Multicore Fibonacci Calculation 

A simple Go script that leverages Fibonacci calculation to multiple cores, indicated by the user.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

To build and run the project, you'll need to have installed theses tools:
1. Go 1.2+ binaries.

### Installing

To prepare your local machine there are just **two** steps. And, also, Google already provides an installation guide, available at [Getting Started](https://golang.org/doc/):

1. After the installation and repository cloning processes, just build and run the **.go** file with:

```go
go build
go run .
```

2. Or you can just run it instead:

```go
go run
```

## Running the tests

There are no unit tests yet. Shame on me, I know.

## Deployment

For now, deployment is not ready. In the future, a GitHub Action will be createad and mantained.
